<p>I am a PhD student at the intersection of geography and computer science. I am getting my degree in Urban and Regional Studies at the University of Birmingham. My supervisors are <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/tranos-emmanouil.aspx">Emmanouil Tranos</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~musolesm/">Mirco Musolesi</a> For my PhD thesis I am mainly interested in the interplay of geography, friendship networks, and communication patterns.</p>
<p>Besides that I am interested in mountaineering, climbing, and brewing.</p>
