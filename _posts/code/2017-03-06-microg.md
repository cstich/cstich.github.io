After much hesitation about the possible time commitment, I have decided to kick Google off my phone. I am not going into the reasons why you might want to do this and this will also be more a rough outline than a specific tutorial. I find tutorials need to be updated too much for what I want to do here. In any case this will walk you through the process of installing [microG](https://microg.org/) on your phone on a high level of abstraction. You will need to be confident rooting your phone, installing custom ROMs, and using *ADB*.

1. Install a ROM that allows signature spoofing so that *microG* can pretend it is *Google Play Services*. At the time of writing the best candidate seemed to be [OmniRom](https://omnirom.org/).

2. Install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) on your phone. Then add the *microG* [repository](https://microg.org/download.html) to *F-Droid* and follow the steps [here](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Installation). Make sure you walk through the self-check *microG* provides to fix any issues. You will definitely need at least a location back-end such as *Mozilla Location Service* as well as a address lockup back-end such as *Nominatim*. They should all be on *F-Droid*. At the time of writing the repository was out of date though, and I needed to download the latest pre-release manually. 

3. If you want to use Google push notifications, register your *Google* account with *microG*.

4. If you plan on using the *Google Play Store* download the apk and dump it into `/system/priv-app` (either via *ADB* or directly on your phone). You need root for this. 

5. Backup your phone with `adb backup -apk -shared -all`, which hopefully should create the `backup.ab` file with all your apps and settings. If you ever need to restore your phone use `adb restore backup.ab`.

In the next post in this series we will talk about, setting up your own server with [sovereign](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign) so that you also can store your data independently of any cloud provider.
