After much hesitation about the possible time commitment, I have decided to kick Google off my phone. I am not going into the reasons why you might want to do this and this will also be more a rough outline than a specific tutorial. I find tutorials need to be updated too much for what I want to do here. In any case this will walk you through the process of installing [microG](https://microg.org/) on your phone

1. Install a ROM that allows signature spoofing so that **microG** can pretend it is **Google Play Services**. At the time of writing the best candidate seemed to be [OmniRom](https://omnirom.org/)

2. Install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) on your phone. Then add the [**microG** repository](https://microg.org/download.html) to **F-Droid** and follow the steps [here](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Installation). Make sure you walk through the self-check **microG** provides to fix any issues. You will definitely need at least a location backend such as **Mozilla Location Service** as well as a address lockup backend such as **Nominatim**. They should all be on **F-Droid**. At the time of writing the repository was out of date though, and I needed to download the latest pre-release manually. 

3. If you want to use Google push notifications, register your **Google** account with **microG**.

4. If you plan on using the **Google Play Store** download the apk and dump it into `/system/priv-app` (either via **ADB** or directly on your phone). You need root for this. 

5. Backup your phone with `adb backup -apk -shared -all`, which hopefull should create the `backup.ab` file with all your apps and settings. If you ever need to restore your phone use `adb restore backup.ab`.
